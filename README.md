#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

it is a discipline that applies engineering principles in the design, development, maintenance ,testind and maintenance of software. it is about cfeating reliable, efficient and cost effective software solutions


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Structured programming (1970): the shift towards structured programming techniques improved code organisation and readability
Object Oriented Programming(1980s-90s): oop concepts rovided a more natural way to model real world systems, leading to increased code readability reusability and maintenance
DevOps(2000s): it focuses on streamlining the software development lifecycle by integrating development and operation teams.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

planning: defining the project scope objectives and gathering user requirements
analysing: analysing requirements and designing the software architecture including data structures algorithms and user interphases
implementation/ coding: writing the actual code based on the system specifications
testing: verifying the systems functionality , performance and security
deployment: releasing the systemto the users or development environment
maintenance: addressing bugs, providing updates and enhaancing the systems performance


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

watrfall methodology is sequential such that a process had to be completed before it moves on to the next. changes are difficult toaccomodate once a phase is complete.it is heavy in documentationit is appropriate for projects with well defined requirements, stable technologies and minimal  need for changes. 
agile methodology on the other hand is iterative and incremental in that development occurs in short cycles with working software being delivered at the end of each cycle.changes are easiy accomodated during the development. it puts empasis on the uer feedback and collaboration. it is suitable for projects with evolving requirements , uncertain technologies and need for feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

a sotware developer writes code based on design specifications, implementa features and functuions, debuggs and troubleshoots issues and collaborates with other team members and deveopers in devloping a system
a quality assurance officer develops and executes test test plans and test cases, identifies and reports bugs, ensures software meets quality standardsand performs various types of testing
a project manager plans and manages the project scope, schedule and budget, coordinates team activities and communication, manages risk and issues and ensures the project is delivered on time an dwithin budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs provide a comprehensive suite of tools such as code editoes, debuggers build automation tools and integrated testing frameworks that streamline the software development process. examples incude VSCode, pycharm ,eclipse

VCS track changes in code overtime,allowing developers to revert to previous versions , collaborate effectively and mange different branches of code.examples are git and github.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

keeping up with current technology. this can be overcome by continous learning
identifying debugging complex issues . this can be overcme by collabotration and effective debugging techniques.
changing requirements within a system. this can be overciome by employing agile methodologies
poor time mangement when developing systems. this can be overcome by time boxing nad prioritization
poor team collaboration. this is overcome by employing clear communication and collaboration tools
technical debts sucha as poor code quality. this is overcome by regular code reviews

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit testing is testing of unitys of code in isolation to ensure each unit of the code functiond eccordingly. it helps identify and fix bugs in the early stages of coding
integration tests are tssts on the integration of different units of code to ensure the units work together as expected. it helps in ensuring the intephases between the components are functioning accordingly.

system tests are tests on the entire system to ensure it meets the intended functions in a real world environment
acceptance tests are  tests on the system from the user perspective to ensure the system is ready for deployment and mets user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

 prompt engineering is is the process of designing and refining text inputs or prompts to give desired outputs from large language ai models  
 it enables users to effectively guide models behaviour and extract desiredinformation and functionality           

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague prompt :'write something about seasons.'
clear orompt :'write a 100 word essay about the winter season'
the second prompt is better because it is clear, specific, concise hence more effective because it enables the ai to to generate a more focused and relevant response.
